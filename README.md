## 🏆 Competition Result: COMPFEST 17 Data Science Academy Selection

This forecasting project was the core of our submission for the **[Seleksi Data Science Academy COMPFEST 17](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/seleksi-dsa-compfest-17/leaderboard)**, a national-level data science competition hosted on Kaggle.

### 🎯 Problem Context
The challenge was to build a predictive model to forecast daily electricity consumption (in GWh). This forecast had to be based on historical weather data (like temperature, solar radiation, wind speed) and time-series data (date, month, year) across various regional clusters.

### 📈 Evaluation
Submissions were evaluated using the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** metric, where a lower score indicates a more accurate prediction.

### 🏅 Achievement
We competed against a total of **261 teams** from across the nation. Our solution proved to be highly competitive, placing us at **Rank 7** on the Public Leaderboard (calculated using 60% of the test data).

* **Our Team:** `Datamate`
    * **Team Lead:** Wisely Janson Halim
    * **Members:** Erin Eriana, Sabrina Rahmadini
* **Rank:** `7 / 261 Teams`
* **Score (RMSE):** `34.0666`

This achievement placed our team in the **Top 3%** of all participants on the public leaderboard.
